# Air Quality Analysis
Clean air is the foremost requirement to sustain healthy lives of humankind and those of the supporting ecosystems which in return affect the human wellbeing. 
Due to the rapid growth of economy and fossil fuel consumption and lack of emission controls, we have experienced substantially elevated concentrations of air pollutants, which not only degrade regional air quality, but also exert significant impacts on public health and global climate.
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.

# Air Quality Analysis
Clean air is the foremost requirement to sustain healthy lives of humankind and those of the supporting ecosystems which in return affect the human wellbeing. 
Due to the rapid growth of economy and fossil fuel consumption and lack of emission controls, we have experienced substantially elevated concentrations of air pollutants, which not only degrade regional air quality, but also exert significant impacts on public health and global climate.
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.

## Cities of Consideration

## Libraries Used:
1. Plotly - https://pypi.org/project/plotly/
3. pandas
4. nympy
6. seaborn
7. matplotlib

## Process Involved 
1. Importing Data
2. Finding Info about Data
3. Fnding Null Values -  As we know climate of different areas are different from others are so the plluting element also. So we get high no. of null values in this data sheet.
4. Finding full description of Data
5. Projecting kernel density estimate (KDE) plot
6. EDA to find verious parameter of AQI (Air Quality  Index)
7. Determine Top 10 City with Heighest AQI
8. Plotting lineplot of year wise AQI of all cities
9. Relation between the PM2.5 and AQI
10. Date wise AQI Chart

## DATA:
The data has been made publicly available by the Central Pollution Control Board: https://cpcb.nic.in/ which is the official portal of Government of India. They also have a real-time monitoring app: https://app.cpcbccr.com/AQI_India/
